We will demo making new RStudio projects, new git repositories, adding git to existing projects, using the RStudio UI for changelists, diffing files, staging, committing, and viewing history, using the terminal tab for git functions not built into the UI, some useful functions in the usethis package, and deploying a git-back project to Posit Connect. If time allows, we may talk about SSH and git credentials.

## 8 - 2023 - No webinar this month

## 7 - 11 - 2023 - Iterating well with purrr by Jenny Bryan

In this webinar we discuss approaches to iteration in R. We briefly discuss iterative techniques that do not require loops or `purrr::map_*()` functions (for example, group_by, vectorized functions, etc.). Then we explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes and explain how to extract elements from a list via the `purrr::map_*()` family. We'll also touch on how some of these ideas and techniques are also exposed in tidyr.
