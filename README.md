- Description: The renv (https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) package helps create reproducible environments for your R projects. In this training we will cover: renv overview, Managing project libraries, Initializing, snapshotting, and restoring R project libraries using renv.

## 02 - 2024 - Creating and Sharing R Packages by Ryan Johnson

- Description: During this 1-hour workshop, users will get hands-on experience creating a simple R package. We'll then discuss ways to share this package using tools such as Posit Package Manager.

## 11 - 2023 - Practical Parallel Workflows

- [Link to Recording (NOAA internal only)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vu0-0nPygyBtYWYsDMGiYUMXX9dDuoTz/view?usp=drive_link)
- [Slides from Roger Andrea at Posit](https://colorado.posit.co/rsc/parallel_thinking/Parallel_Thinking.html)
- Description: Come for a more informal session of the Posit Webinar! This month, we'll be discussing Practical Parallel Processing Workflows with Jeremy Allen and guests from Posit. We would love to have you share your experiences (and code) for Parallel Processing, either from R or not. We will focus on easy to parallelize problems (what is colloquially known as "perfectly parallel" or "embarassingly parallel" situations). This will be a more interactive and discussion-based session, with lots of time to demo workflows, and ask and answer questions. The folks from Posit will also share their experiences in Parallel processing.

## 10 - 2023 - Rstudio projects with git and the usethis package

- [Slides](https://colorado.posit.co/rsc/git-rstudio/)
- [Link to recording (NOAA internal only)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11G7JHdeK0B8uHZjc_dR4qP9igM1cTUX0/view?usp=sharing)

We will demo making new RStudio projects, new git repositories, adding git to existing projects, using the RStudio UI for changelists, diffing files, staging, committing, and viewing history, using the terminal tab for git functions not built into the UI, some useful functions in the usethis package, and deploying a git-back project to Posit Connect. If time allows, we may talk about SSH and git credentials.

## 9 - 2023 - Moving Faster With R: Parallel Processing (overview)

## 8 - 2023 - No webinar this month

## 7 - 11 - 2023 - Iterating well with purrr by Jenny Bryan

In this webinar we discuss approaches to iteration in R. We briefly discuss iterative techniques that do not require loops or `purrr::map_*()` functions (for example, group_by, vectorized functions, etc.). Then we explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes and explain how to extract elements from a list via the `purrr::map_*()` family. We'll also touch on how some of these ideas and techniques are also exposed in tidyr.
