## Future Webinars

- 7 - 11 - 2023 - Iterating well with purrr. In this webinar we discuss approaches to iteration in R. We briefly discuss iterative techniques that do not require loops or `purrr::map_*()` functions (for example, group_by, vectorized functions, etc.). Then we explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes and explain how to extract elements from a list via the `purrr::map_*()` family. We'll also touch on how some of these ideas and techniques are also exposed in tidyr.
